//Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many people purchased a ticket?
const ticketsTotalAmount = 6450;
const ticketPrice = 15;
const numberOfPeople = ticketsTotalAmount / ticketPrice; 
console.log(`01: ${numberOfPeople} bought tickets`);

//Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?
console.log(`02: Beträg in Jahr = ${500 * 52} `);
//Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: number%

let x = 17;
let y = 30;
let percentage = x * 100 /y;
console.log(`Q3: ${percentage}% `);

//Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.
const sideLenght = 4.75;
const Perimeter = sideLenght * 4;
console.log(`04: Perimeter of square is ${Perimeter}cm`);

//Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.
console.log(`05: Perimeter ofa triangle is ${5+6+7}cm`);
//Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.
console.log(`06: Area of squar is ${5 ** 2}cm²`);
//Q7. Calculate the area of a right-angled triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 3cm, 4cm, 5cm.
// a right-angled triangle is half of a rectangle shaped by the "legs" of the trigangle (gr. catheti)

console.log(`07: The area of a right-angled triangle is ${(3 * 4) / 2}cm² `);

console.log(4 / 2 * 3);

//Q8. Calculate the volume of a cube. Length of each side is 9cm.
